### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yuheng Lin, currently an MSc student in CUHK (Hong Kong SAR, China), majoring in MSc in Information Engineering.

I just began my deep learning journey on the topic of intelligent audio.

If you are, or grinding to be a deep audio learner, feel free to collaborate with me.

My email is ly432@ie.cuhk.edu.hk.
